= 3.1.0 =

* Feature - Options for default templates to disable HTML fields or empty fields (or both)

= 3.0.0 =
As of Gravity PDF v3.0.0 we have removed the DOMPDF package from our plugin and integrated the more advanced mPDF system. Along with a new HTML to PDF generator, we've rewritten the entire plugin's base code to make it more user friendly to both hobbyists and rock star web developers. Configuration time is cut in half and advanced features like adding security features is now accessible to users who have little experience with PHP.

New Features include:

* Language Support - almost all languages are supported including RTL (right to left) languages like Arabic and Hebrew and CJK languages - Chinese, Japanese and Korean.
* HTML Page Numbering
* Odd and even paging with mirrored margins (most commonly used in printing).
* Nested Tables
* Text-justification and hyphenation
* Table of Contents
* Index
* Bookmarks
* Watermarks
* Password protection
* UTF-8 encoded HTML
* Better system resource handling

A new HTML to PDF package wasn't the only change to this edition of the software. We have rewritten the entire configuration system and made it super easy to get the software up and running.

Users will no longer place code in their active theme's functions.php file. Instead, configuration will happen in a new file called configuration.php, inside the PDF_EXTENDED_TEMPLATES folder (in your active theme).

Other changes include
* Improved security - further restrictions were placed on non-administrators viewing template files.
* $form_data array tidied up - images won't be wrapped in anchor tags.

For more details [view the 3.x.x online documentation](https://developer.gravitypdf.com/).

= 2.2.3 =
* Bug - Fixed mb_string error in the updated DOMPDF package.

= 2.2.2 =
* DOMPDF - We updated to the latest version of DOMPDF - DOMPDF 0.6.0 beta 3.
* DOMPDF - We've enabled font subsetting by default which should help limit the increased PDF size when using DejaVu Sans (or any other font).

= 2.2.1 =
* Bug - Fixed HTML error which caused list items to distort on PDF

= 2.2.0 =
* Compatibility - Ensure compatibility with Gravity Forms 1.7. We've updated the functions.php code and remove gform_user_notification_attachments and gform_admin_notification_attachments hooks which are now deprecated. Functions gform_pdf_create and gform_add_attachment have been removed and replaced with gfpdfe_create_and_attach_pdf(). See upgrade documentation for details.
* Enhancement - Added deployment code switch so the template redeployment feature can be turned on and off. This release doesn't require redeployment.
* Enhancement - PDF_Generator() variables were getting long and complex so the third variable is now an array which will pass all the optional arguments. The new 1.7 compatible functions.php code includes this method by default. For backwards compatibility the function will still work with the variable structure prior to 2.2.0.
* Bug - Fixed error generated by legacy code in the function PDF_processing() which is located in render_to_pdf.php.
* Bug - Images and stylesheets will now try and be accessed with a local path instead of a URL. It fixes problem where some hosts were preventing read access from a URL. No template changes are required.

* Security - Tightened PDF template security so that custom templates couldn't be automatically generated by just anyone. Now only logged in users with the correct privileges and the user who submitted the form (matched against IP) can auto generate a PDF. See documentation on usage.
* Deprecated - Removed form data that was added directly to the $form_data array instead of $form_data['field'] array. Users upgrading will need to update their custom templates if not using field data from the $form_data[�field'] array. If using $form_data['field'] in your custom template this won't affect you.
* Bug - Fixed problem with default template not showing and displaying a timeout error. Removed table tags and replaced with divs that are styled appropriately.
* Bug - The new plugin theme folder will successfully create when upgrading. You won't have to deactivate and reactivate to get it working.

* Bug - Remove empty signature field from the default template.
